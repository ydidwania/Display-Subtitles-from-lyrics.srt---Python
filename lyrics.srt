00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Party girls don't get hurt

1
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,100
Can't feel anything, when will I
learn?

2
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:22,100
I push it down, push it down

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,800
I'm the one "for a good time
call"

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,600
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my
doorbell

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,700
I feel the love, feel the love

6
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,500
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,200
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,100
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink

9
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,900
Throw 'em back 'til I lose count

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm gonna swing from the
chandelier, from the chandelier

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm gonna live like tomorrow
doesn't exist

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,100
Like it doesn't exist

13
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:14,300
I'm gonna fly like a bird
through the night, feel my tears
as they dry

14
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:25,100
I'm gonna swing from the
chandelier, from the chandelier

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,300
But I'm holding on for dear
life, won't look down, won't
open my eyes

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:38,100
Keep my glass full until morning
light, 'cause I'm just holding
on for tonight

17
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,300
Help me, I'm holding on for dear
life, won't look down, won't
open my eyes

18
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,000
Keep my glass full until morning
light, 'cause I'm just holding
on for tonight

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,600
On for tonight

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,000
Sun is up, I'm a mess

21
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,400
Gotta get out now, gotta run
from this

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,100
Here comes the shame, here comes
the shame

23
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,700
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, drink
